Different symbols used in regex =>
* -> zero or more occurances of a letter.
. -> a wildcard that represents any character.
\s -> represents whitespace.
[pqr] -> a single character that can either be 'p' , 'q' or 'r'.
[a-d] -> Single character that falls between a to d.
[^pq] -> A single character that can neither be p or q.
^ -> The symbol represents begining of new line.
^ -> Also used as negation symbol iff it is inside square bracket.
$ -> This is an anchor that represents the end of line.
\ -> It is considered whatever letter immediately follows the backlash as literal(in cases where literal followed is a symbols that can be used as special symbols also).
+ -> one or more occurances of character that proceeds symbol.
? -> zero or occurances of char that proceeds ?.
(pattern1|pattern2) -> matches either pattern1 or pattern 2.
() -> divides into groups.
{m} -> exactly 'm' occurances of whatever proceeds.
{m,n} -> at least m and atmost occurances of whatever proceeds. 
(m,} or {,n} -> Only one of m,n is mandatory. Other can be left blank.
| -> it is used to anyone betwen the two options. 

Combination symbols used =>
.* -> Zero or more occurances of any letter.
\s * -> 0 or more occurances of whitespace.
[p-sa] -> All letters  including 'p' to 's' and 'a'.
^a$ -> The string will start and end at 'a'.
\b -> It is used to determine the word boundry anchor. 
{ \bcar\b ->this will determine word in sentence "I have a car" but not in sentence "Lets Carpool".
^\bcar\b -> determine the car word at th starting of sentence like "Car is so unique."
\bworld\b$ -> determine the world word at the end of sentence like "Hello World".
.}
(ply|log)wood -> this regex will give either plywood or logwood.

If the special symbols need to be used as literals =>
 [.] -> If the period symbol is to be used inside brackets it does not need '\' as this does not mean anything special inside brackets.
 [\^] or [\\] -> For the symbols ^ or \ symbols we need '\' to be used as they are used as special symbols inside brackets.

-E symbol -> This is required if you are using any symbol from POSIX extended set in regex.
-r symbol -> Enables the posix extended set.
POSIX -> Portable operation System Interface (based on UNIX OS).

GREP AND SED => 
The commands can be written using 'grep' keyword with or without -E symbol.
example-> grep 'your pattern in single quotes' file_name
          grep -E 'your pattern in single quotes' file_name

Other method that can be used is using 'sed' keyword with -r symbol(mostly used for finding a nd replacing pattern).
example -> sed -r 's/pattern/replacment/g' file_name
