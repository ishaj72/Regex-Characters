Different symbols used in regex =>

* -> zero or more occurances of a letter
. -> a wildcard that represents any character
\s -> represents whitespace
[pqr] -> a single character that can either be 'p' , 'q' or 'r'
[a-d] -> Single character that falls between a to d
[^pq] -> A single character that can neither be p or q
^ -> The symbol represents begining of new line
^ -> Also used as negation symbol iff it is inside square bracket
$ -> This is an anchor that represents the end of line 
\ -> It is considered whatever letter immediately follows the backlash as literal(in cases where literal followed is a symbols that can be used as special symbols also)

Combination symbols used =>
.* -> Zero or more occurances of any letter
\s * -> 0 or more occurances of whitespace
[p-sa] -> All letters  including 'p' to 's' and 'a'

If the special symbols need to be used as literals =>
 [.] -> If the period symbol is to be used inside brackets it does not need '\' as this does not mean anything special inside brackets.
 [\^] or [\\] -> For the symbols ^ or \ symbols we need '\' to be used as they are used as special symbols inside brackets
